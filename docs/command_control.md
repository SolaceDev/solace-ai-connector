# Command and Control in the Solace AI Connector

The Solace AI Connector has a general facitity to allow for command and control by
way of events from the Solace Event Mesh. This is highly configurable and extensible
for the type of application being built.


## Section for architecture thoughts

My thoughts:

1. Each solace-ai-connector instance will have a single instance of a command and control
   object. 
2. Components within flows can register with the command and control object to be a 
   managed entity. The registration will provide a name for the entity and a list of
    commands that the entity can handle. It will also provide all configuration for
    the entity, including whether that config can be changed at runtime.
3. From the point of view of the higher level system (the external app that manages the
   solace-ai-connector), it should look the same if there are many instances of the
   solace-ai-connector, each with a single managed entity, or if there is a single
   instance of the solace-ai-connector with many managed entities.
4. The command and control object will have a single topic that it listens on for
   commands. The topic will be configurable in the config file.
5. The command and control object will also have a mechanism to publish messages to the
   event mesh. This will be used to send responses to commands as well as to send
   general status updates, metrics and trace information.

Let's collaborate in this section to think through how to implement a generic command 
and control system in the Solace AI Connector.

Use my thoughts above and add your own below to help us think through the architecture of the
command and control system.
