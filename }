This registration structure provides a comprehensive view of each entity, including:

1. **Basic Identity**: Unique identifiers, type, name, and description
2. **Command Interface**: All commands the entity can handle, with parameters and response schemas
3. **Metrics**: Measurable values the entity can report
4. **Status Reporting**: Current operational state attributes
5. **Configuration Management**: Current configuration and which parts can be modified at runtime

The command and control system would maintain a registry of all entities and their capabilities, allowing for discovery, introspection, and validation of commands before execution.

## Command and Response Structure

### Command Structure
Commands should follow a consistent structure with fields like:
- `command_id`: Unique identifier for tracking/correlation
- `command_type`: The action to perform (e.g., "start_flow", "stop_flow", "update_config")
- `target_entity`: The specific component or flow to target
- `parameters`: Command-specific parameters
- `timestamp`: When the command was issued
- `source`: Who/what issued the command

### Response Structure
Similarly, responses should have:
- `command_id`: Matching the original command
- `status`: Success/failure
- `message`: Human-readable result or error message
- `data`: Any returned data
- `timestamp`: When the response was generated

### Topic Structure
A hierarchical topic structure would be beneficial:
- Commands: `command/solace-ai-connector/{instance_id}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`
- Responses: `response/solace-ai-connector/{instance_id}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{command_id}`
- Status: `status/solace-ai-connector/{instance_id}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`
- Metrics: `metrics/solace-ai-connector/{instance_id}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`

## Implementation Considerations

### Command Handler Registry
The command and control object should maintain a registry mapping commands to handler functions, allowing components to register their capabilities.

### Security Considerations
- Authentication for command issuers
- Authorization for specific commands
- Validation of command parameters
- Audit logging of all commands

### State Management
- Track current state of all managed entities
- Maintain history of commands and their outcomes
- Support for idempotent commands

### Integration with Existing Components
- Leverage the existing broker components for messaging
- Use the existing monitoring system for metrics
- Integrate with the cache service for state persistence

### Resilience Features
- Command timeout handling
- Retry mechanisms for failed commands
- Circuit breakers for problematic entities
- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle versioning of commands and responses as the system evolves?
2. Should we implement a priority system for commands, or a way to cancel in-progress commands?
3. How will we handle distributed command execution across multiple instances?
4. What's the approach for handling long-running commands that might exceed typical request/response timeframes?
5. Should we implement a command queue to handle rate limiting or execution ordering?
