## 6. Running Tests

The tests in this project are designed to be run using the `pytest` framework. Your project uses `hatch` for environment and build management, as defined in `pyproject.toml`.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Install `hatch`:**
    If you don't have `hatch` installed, you can install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install hatch
    ```

2.  **Set up the test environment and install dependencies:**
    `hatch` uses the `pyproject.toml` file to manage environments and dependencies.
    The `llm` components require dependencies defined under `project.optional-dependencies.llm`.
    Test-specific dependencies like `pytest` and `pytest-mock` are defined in `project.optional-dependencies.test` and should be installed into the test environment.

    To create or update the `hatch-test` environment (as defined in your `pyproject.toml`) and install necessary dependencies including the `llm` and `test` extras:
    ```bash
    hatch env create hatch-test  # If the environment doesn't exist or to ensure it's up-to-date
    # Install the project in editable mode along with 'llm' and 'test' extras
    hatch run hatch-test:pip install -e .[llm,test]
    ```
    The `tool.hatch.envs.hatch-test.dependencies` section in `pyproject.toml` also lists base test dependencies which `hatch` will install.

### Execution
1.  **Navigate to the project root:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the root directory of the Solace AI Connector project (the directory that contains `pyproject.toml`, `src`, and `tests` folders).

2.  **Run `pytest` commands via `hatch`:**
    It's recommended to run `pytest` within the context of the `hatch` managed environment to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved.

    *   **Run all tests:**
        To discover and run all tests in the project using the `hatch-test` environment:
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest
        ```
        or, if you have a specific script defined in `pyproject.toml` for tests (e.g., `hatch run test`):
        ```bash
        hatch run test # (or similar, depending on your hatch scripts)
        ```

    *   **Run tests in a specific file:**
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest tests/components/general/llm/test_litellm_base.py
        ```

    *   **Run tests in a specific directory:**
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest tests/components/general/llm/
        ```

    *   **Run a specific test class:**
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest tests/components/general/llm/test_litellm_base.py::TestLiteLLMBaseInitialization
        ```

    *   **Run a specific test method:**
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest tests/components/general/llm/test_litellm_base.py::TestLiteLLMBaseInitialization::test_initialization_with_defaults_and_minimal_config
        ```

    *   **Passing additional `pytest` options via `hatch`:**
        To pass options like `-v` (verbose) or `-k` (keyword expression) to `pytest` when running through `hatch`, append them after `--` if your hatch script directly calls `pytest [...]`:
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest -- -v
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest -- -k "initialization"
        ```
        If your hatch script is just `pytest` (e.g. `scripts = ["pytest"]`), then:
        ```bash
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest -v
        hatch run hatch-test:pytest -k "initialization"
        ```
        Consult `hatch` documentation for the precise way to pass arguments to the underlying command based on your `hatch` script definitions.

        Common `pytest` options:
        -   `-v` for verbose output.
        -   `-k "expression"` to run tests whose names match the given expression.
        -   `-m marker_name` to run tests decorated with a specific marker.
        -   `--lf` or `--last-failed` to run only the tests that failed during the last run.
        -   `--ff` or `--failed-first` to run all tests but run the last failed tests first.

        Refer to the `pytest` and `hatch` documentation for more comprehensive information.
