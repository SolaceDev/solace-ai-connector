  Ok. Now a challenging request for you. 
  
  I want to make an example for the websocket_input and websocket_output components. This webapp will do:

  1. There is a section at the top that manages connecting to the server. It takes a URL and has a Connect button. 
     The URL should default to ws://localhost:5000. When the Connect button is pressed, it should connect to the 
     server. If it is already connected, it should disconnect and change the button text to "Connect". 
     If it is not connected, it should connect and change the button text to "Disconnect".
  2. Lower on the page there is a textarea in which the user can input JSON. When the user presses Enter, the JSON 
     should be sent to the server.
  3. Below the textarea, there is a div that displays the JSON that is received from the server. Each JSON object
     should be displayed in a separate div. The div should be formatted with a border and padding so that it is 
     easy to read.
  4. Do your best to make the page look nice using css embedded in the html file.

  Leave this text here and add your code below. Good luck!
